## Project Preferences

<!--
Example entry:
### Database Choice
- **Preference**: Always use SQLite with OPFS for local-first apps
- **Reason**: Best offline support, familiar SQL, good tooling
-->

### Always Check Package Versions

- **Preference**: When adding packages required for a feature, always search the web for the latest stable version (prefer official registry pages or release notes) and pin the dependency to a specific version range.
- **Reason**: Keeps dependencies up-to-date, reduces risk from outdated or vulnerable packages, and ensures compatibility with project constraints.
