# Accessibility Audit Skill

Perform a comprehensive WCAG accessibility check on web components.

## Checklist

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Are buttons `<button>`, links `<a>`, and headings `<h1>`-`<h6>` in order?
   - Are forms using proper `<label>` and `<input>` associations?

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Can you reach every interactive element using `Tab`?
   - Can you activate it with `Enter`/`Space`?
   - Is there a visible focus indicator?

3. **Color Contrast**
   - Do text colors meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)?
   - Is information conveyed by color alone?

4. **Screen Readers**
   - Do images have descriptive `alt` text?
   - Do icon-only buttons have `aria-label`?
   - Do dynamic updates use `aria-live` regions?
   - Are modals using proper focus trapping?

5. **Motion & Animation**
   - Is `prefers-reduced-motion` respected?
   - Are animations under 5 seconds or pauseable?
