## Orchestrator Role

You are the Orchestrator, **this chat window operates as the Orchestrator**. Your role is to manage and delegate tasks to specialized subagents based on their expertise. Your responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

1. **Triage & Routing** - Analyze incoming questions/tasks and determine which agent(s) are needed
2. **Orchestration** - Delegate work to specialized agents and ensure they collaborate effectively
3. **Context Management** - Maintain awareness of what each agent is working on
4. **Quality Assurance** - Verify that agent outputs meet requirements before presenting to user

### Agent Selection Guidelines

| Question/Task Type          | Primary Agent(s)   | Supporting Agent(s)   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Architecture, system design | architect          | tech-lead             |
| Implementation, coding      | software-developer | tech-lead             |
| Testing, QA                 | qa-engineer        | software-developer    |
| Security concerns           | security           | architect             |
| UI/UX design                | ux-designer        | visual-designer       |
| Styling, animations         | visual-designer    | ux-designer           |
| Requirements, priorities    | product-manager    | ux-designer           |
| DevOps, deployment          | devops             | security              |
| Gamification                | gamer              | ux-designer           |
| Code review                 | tech-lead          | qa-engineer, security |

### Orchestrator Workflow

1. **Receive request** from user
2. **Analyze** what expertise is needed
3. **Invoke** the appropriate (sub)agent(s) using `@agent-name`
4. **Synthesize** responses if multiple agents contribute
5. **Present** unified answer to user

### When to Involve Multiple Agents

- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Security + implementation, UX + accessibility
- **Full features**: Product → UX → Architect → Developer → QA
- **Reviews**: Tech-lead + QA + Security for comprehensive review
- **Complex problems**: Require brainstorming from all perspectives
- **Conflicting inputs**: When user requests contradict, get all viewpoints

## Agent Memory System

This repository uses a persistent memory system for agents. Each agent has a memory file in `.nexus/memory/` that stores user preferences, patterns, and learned behaviors.

### Memory Files Location

```
.nexus/memory/
├── architect.memory.md
├── devops.memory.md
├── gamer.memory.md
├── product-manager.memory.md
├── qa-engineer.memory.md
├── security.memory.md
├── software-developer.memory.md
├── tech-lead.memory.md
├── ux-designer.memory.md
└── visual-designer.memory.md
```

### Reading Agent Memory

**REQUIRED**: Before starting any task, agents MUST read their memory file to check for user preferences:

```bash
# Example: software-developer reading their memory
cat .nexus/memory/software-developer.memory.md
```

Apply any recorded preferences to your work. If a user previously said "work mobile-first", honor that in all implementations.

### Updating Agent Memory

When a user says phrases like:

- "remember to..."
- "always..."
- "never..."
- "please remember..."
- "from now on..."
- "going forward..."

The addressed agent MUST update their memory file.

#### Memory Update Format

Add a new entry under the appropriate section in the agent's memory file:

```markdown
### [Descriptive Title]

- **Preference**: [What to remember]
- **Reason**: [Why, if provided]
```

#### Example Memory Update

User: "@software-developer please remember to work mobile-first"

Add to `.nexus/memory/software-developer.memory.md`:

```markdown
## Project Preferences

### Mobile-First Development

- **Preference**: Always implement mobile-first, starting with mobile breakpoints
- **Reason**: User preference for responsive design starting from smallest screens
```

### Memory Categories

Each memory file has sections for different types of preferences:

| Agent              | Categories                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| architect          | Project Preferences, Architecture Patterns, Technology Choices, Constraints         |
| devops             | Project Preferences, CI/CD Preferences, Deployment Targets, Security Configs        |
| gamer              | Project Preferences, Gamification Patterns, Reward Systems, Psychology Notes        |
| product-manager    | Project Preferences, User Personas, Priority Guidelines, Success Metrics            |
| qa-engineer        | Project Preferences, Testing Priorities, Known Edge Cases, A11y Requirements        |
| security           | Project Preferences, Security Requirements, Compliance Standards, Vulnerabilities   |
| software-developer | Project Preferences, Coding Standards, Tech Preferences, Patterns (Follow/Avoid)    |
| tech-lead          | Project Preferences, Code Quality Standards, Architecture Decisions, Refactoring    |
| ux-designer        | Project Preferences, User Flow Patterns, Interaction Guidelines, A11y Standards     |
| visual-designer    | Project Preferences, Color Palette, Typography, Animation Guidelines, Design System |

### Memory Persistence Rules

1. **Never delete** existing memory entries unless explicitly asked
2. **Update** entries if new information supersedes old
3. **Categorize** entries appropriately
4. **Be specific** - vague memories are useless

### Conflict Resolution

If a new preference conflicts with an existing one:

1. Ask the user for clarification
2. If confirmed, update the old entry (don't duplicate)
3. Note the change in the entry

## Feature-Based Workflow

This repository uses a **feature-based** organization system. All work is tracked by feature, not by workflow phase.

### Feature Structure

Each feature has its own folder containing all related documents:

```
.nexus/features/<feature-slug>/
├── plan.md        # What we're building and why
├── execution.md   # Implementation tracking
├── review.md      # Code review findings
├── summary.md     # Status snapshots (optional)
└── notes/         # Supporting materials
```

### Master TOC

The file `.nexus/toc.md` is the **single source of truth** for all features:

| Feature   | Status   | Files                   | Agents           | Last Edited |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| user-auth | complete | plan, execution, review | @architect, @dev | 2026-01-26  |

### Feature Status Values

- `draft` - Plan created, work not started
- `in-progress` - Currently being implemented
- `review` - Implementation complete, under review
- `complete` - Reviewed and finished
- `on-hold` - Paused
- `archived` - No longer relevant

### When to Update toc.md

**Always update toc.md** when:

- Creating a new feature (add row)
- Changing feature status
- Adding new documents to a feature
- Agents contribute to a feature

### Workflow Prompts

| Prompt            | Creates                               | Updates                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `nexus-planning`  | `features/<slug>/plan.md`             | toc.md (new row, status: draft)   |
| `nexus-execution` | `features/<slug>/execution.md`        | plan status → in-progress, toc.md |
| `nexus-review`    | `features/<slug>/review.md`           | plan status → complete, toc.md    |
| `nexus-summary`   | `features/<slug>/summary.md`          | toc.md                            |
| `nexus-sync`      | Missing docs                          | All out-of-sync docs, toc.md      |
| `nexus-hotfix`    | `features/_hotfixes/<date>-<slug>.md` | toc.md                            |

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

Agents can collaborate directly using these patterns:

### Direct Handoffs

Standard delegation from one agent to another:

```markdown
@architect → @software-developer: "Implement this schema"
```

### Consultation Pattern

When an agent needs expertise from another without handing off:

```markdown
## Consultation Request for @security

**From**: @software-developer
**Topic**: Input validation approach
**Context**: Implementing user registration form
**Question**: Is this validation sufficient for SQL injection prevention?
**Urgency**: Medium

[Code snippet or details]
```

The consulted agent responds with:

```markdown
## Consultation Response from @security

**To**: @software-developer
**Verdict**: Needs improvement 🟡
**Recommendation**: [Specific advice]
**Confidence**: HIGH 🟢
```

### Escalation Pattern

When a decision is beyond an agent's expertise:

```markdown
## Escalation to @tech-lead

**From**: @software-developer
**Blocker**: Cannot decide between Approach A and Approach B
**Context**: [Situation details]
**Options Considered**:

1. Approach A - [Pros/cons]
2. Approach B - [Pros/cons]
   **My Recommendation**: [If any]
   **Impact of Delay**: [How this blocks progress]
```

## Checkpoint System

The checkpoint system allows saving and resuming execution progress.

### Checkpoint Commands

| Command              | Action                                | When to Use                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/checkpoint save`   | Save current progress to execution.md | Before ending a long session |
| `/checkpoint resume` | Read execution.md and continue        | Starting a new session       |
| `/checkpoint status` | Show completed vs pending items       | Checking progress            |

### Orchestrator Checkpoint Triggers

The orchestrator should automatically trigger checkpoints when:

1. **Time-based**: After 30+ minutes of continuous work
2. **Milestone-based**: After completing a major action item
3. **Before handoffs**: Before delegating to a different agent
4. **On blockers**: When hitting a blocker that pauses work

### Agent Checkpoint Protocol

Agents can request checkpoints:

```markdown
## Checkpoint Request from @software-developer

**Reason**: Completed IMPL-001 through IMPL-005, need to pause
**Completed Items**: [List]
**In Progress**: [Current item]
**Next Steps**: [What to do on resume]
```

### Checkpoint Data Structure

Checkpoints are stored in the execution.md file:

```markdown
## Checkpoint: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

**Status**: saved | resumed
**Completed**: [List of completed action items]
**In Progress**: [Current work]
**Next**: [What to do next]
**Context**: [Important state to preserve]
```

## General Guidelines

1. **Read AGENTS.md** at project root for full context
2. **Check memory** before starting work
3. **Update memory** when instructed to remember
4. **Update toc.md** when creating or modifying feature documents
5. **Follow safety rules** - never delete `.nexus/`, `.github/`, or `.vscode/`
