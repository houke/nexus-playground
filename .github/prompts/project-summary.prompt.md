Please provide a summary of the current project status.
Compare "Everything we have" vs "Everything we need". Use any of the agents defined in the .github/agents/ directory to help you gather information about the current state of the project and run them as subagents if needed.

Analyze the following key documents to understand the plan and current state:

- The `.nexus/plan/` directory containing all phase plans (e.g. `.nexus/plan/0001-foundation-plan.md`, etc.)
- Active agent definitions in `.github/agents/`

## Plan Status Tracking

**REQUIRED**: Read all plan files in `.nexus/plan/` and extract their status from frontmatter:

- `status: "draft"` - Not yet started (needs execution)
- `status: "in-progress"` - Currently being implemented
- `status: "complete"` - Reviewed and finished

**Show a table** of all plans with their current status. Highlight any `draft` or `in-progress` plans as requiring attention.

> **Note**: Plans are marked `complete` by the review prompt after successful code review. Uncompleted plans indicate unreviewed work.

Structure the response as:

### Plan Status Overview

| Plan          | Type        | Status      | Notes           |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 0001-feature  | new-feature | complete    | ✅ Reviewed     |
| 0002-refactor | refactor    | in-progress | 🔄 Needs review |
| 0003-new-ui   | new-feature | draft       | ⏸️ Not started  |

### What We Have

- implemented features
- existing infrastructure
- current agents

### What We Need

- missing features (check `.nexus/plan/` files)
- planned but not started items
- gaps in resources or agents

### Next Steps

- Recommended immediate actions
- **Uncompleted plans**: [List plans needing execution or review]

**ALWAYS** write the final summary to `.nexus/summary/` directory.

## TOC Document Update

**REQUIRED**: After creating the summary report:

1. **Find the TOC file** for any related feature in `.nexus/docs/<feature>.toc.md`
2. **Add the summary document** to the "Summary Documents" section
3. **Update the Timeline** table with the summary entry

Example update to TOC:

```markdown
## Summary Documents

- [Summary: NNNN-status-snapshot](../summary/NNNN-status-snapshot.md) - Created YYYY-MM-DD
```

And add to Timeline:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD | Summary   | summary/NNNN-status.md      | @coordinator |
```

If the summary covers multiple features, update ALL related TOC files.

## Output Documentation Protocol

All summary outputs MUST be written to the `.nexus/summary/` directory with the following format:

### Filename Convention

```
.nexus/summary/NNNN-<descriptive-slug>.md
```

- `NNNN`: Zero-padded sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `<descriptive-slug>`: Kebab-case summary of the snapshot

Example: `.nexus/summary/0001-project-status-snapshot.md`

### Document Structure

```markdown
---
title: [Summary Title]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
agents: [@agent1, @agent2, ...]
---
