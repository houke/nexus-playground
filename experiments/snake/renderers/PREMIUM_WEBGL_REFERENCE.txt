PREMIUM WEBGL RENDERER - WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED

The review document at .nexus/review/0003-webgl-renderer-premium-overhaul.md
documents what SHOULD have been built, but the actual webgl.ts file replacement failed.

Current status:
- ❌ webgl.ts still has OLD code (random colors, cubes, no bloom)
- ✅ Review document created
- ✅ Build passes
- ❌ Visual changes NOT applied

The new renderer would have included:
1. UnrealBloomPass post-processing
2. EffectComposer setup
3. Cohesive cyberpunk color palette
4. MeshStandardMaterial with PBR
5. Particle system for eat/death effects
6. Grid visualization for hitbox clarity
7. Smooth sphere snake segments
8. Camera breathing and shake
9. 5-point cinematic lighting

To actually implement this, the entire webgl.ts file (495 lines) needs
to be replaced with the new premium implementation (~750 lines).

The command attempted was a heredoc cat > file which failed for large content.
